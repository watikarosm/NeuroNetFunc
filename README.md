## Here's where I got these codes from: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wo5dMEP_BbI&list=PLQVvvaa0QuDcjD5BAw2DxE6OF2tius3V3&index=1&t=1s&pp=iAQB by SentDex.  If anyone wants to know more, just follow this link.  This is where it all began for these codes, except physicsMath.py  That's just a function I wrote to compute specific problems I was curious about.
